A long time ago I made a design for the Videopac G7000 to output RGB. I decided I could do a bit better and opted for a mini pcb that solders directly to the motherboard. In this repository I'll post:

- Gerbers (done)
- Schematics (done)
- BOM (done)
- Basic installation instructions/photo's (to be done)

To do on this mod could be resizing the components to 0201 and adding bypass caps to every IC. When I designed this a couple of years ago I was not able to solder 0201 by hand so I stuck to 0402, which greatly diminished the available space on the board. If anyone feels like doing so... have a go at it! :-)
